This plugin allows you to insert tabs only for indentation.
If left part of the cursor position in current line has only tabs or spaces,
then they will be replaced by tabs and one more tab will be added. 
In other cases, only spaces will be added. That's all.
I think, it will helpful because tabs not used for code alignment.
But, if you really need to insert tab, you can use <S-Tab> for this.

PS: Sorry, another plugin doing the same can be found here:

I didn't search at all.
